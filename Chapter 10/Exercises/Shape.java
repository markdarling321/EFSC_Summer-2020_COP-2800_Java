// EXERCISE 10.14  --  PROJECT: SHAPE HIERARCHY

/*
10.14 (Project: Shape Hierarchy)

Implement the Shape hierarchy shown in Fig. 9.3 . Each TwoDimensionalShape should
contain method getArea to calculate the area of the two-dimensional shape. Each
ThreeDimensionalShape should have methods getArea and getVolume to calculate the
surface area and volume, respectively, of the three-dimensional shape. Create a
program that uses an array of Shape references to objects of each concrete class
in the hierarchy. The program should print a text description of the object to
which each array element refers. Also, in the loop that processes all the shapes
in the array, determine whether each shape is a TwoDimensionalShape or a
ThreeDimensionalShape. If it’s a TwoDimensionalShape, display its area. If it’s
a ThreeDimensionalShape, display its area and volume.
